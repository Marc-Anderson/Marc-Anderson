Welcome! I am always looking few new opportunities. Learning new skills and digging into complex or challenging topics is something I've always been fascinated with. I have a lot of wide-ranging hobbies, but I'm currently really enjoying building and flying multirotors as well as photography and videography. I look forward to continuing to explore myself and expand my areas of expertise, while contributing my knowledge and skill where it's needed most. If you have an opportunity you think I would be a good fit for, I would love to hear from you, so shoot me an email.
